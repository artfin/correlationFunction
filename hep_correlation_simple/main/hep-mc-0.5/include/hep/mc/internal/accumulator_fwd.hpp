// The accumulator class is where the actual calculation of the total integral
// and all distributions, if they exist, happens. It serves three purposes:
//
// 1. If distributions should be generated, then we have to pass the integrand
//    an additional object that (indirectly) exposes the member function
//    `add_to_distribution` of the accumulator class that the user needs to
//    define the distributions. If no distributions should be generated we have
//    a different implementation of the class, `accumulator<T, false>`, which
//    passes only the Monte Carlo point to the integrand and completely skips
//    the potentially time-consuming generation of distributions.
// 2. The accumulation is performed in a central place for all integrators.
// 3. The intermediate results (sum, sum_of_squars) for all distributions
//    and the total integral is stored in a single vector that can be easily
//    distributed when the integration is performed on multiple cores.
